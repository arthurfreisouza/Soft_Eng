# ðŸ¤– Software Engineering - GitHub Repository:

This is a **Software Engineering project from UFMG (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais)**. The goal of the project is to create a platform which has some Generative Artificial Intelligence solutions and tools. The aim is to put the Artificial Intelligence solutions more accessible to the people, taking into account the high prices charged from the companies such as OpenAI or Antrophic to use their services. So, here, we are going to have some free solutions such as an image generator, a document information extractor and an image descriptor. The project involves the integration of the frontend (the creation of the visible part of the site and the prompts to interact with the LLM), and the backend, that is where the generative AI solutions are stated.

**The group is formed by the following members :**
**Arthur Felipe Reis Souza, registration : 2021013884.**
**Guilheme, registration : .**
**Luis, registration : .**
**Pedro, registration : .**

**The teacher who is teaching the subject is :**
**Marco TÃºlio de Oliveira Valente**

The **histories** of the project will be assigned to each group member. The initial goal is to gain a foundational understanding of GenAI (without delving too deeply) and conduct research to enhance your understanding of its applications and how to develop projects using GenAI. We are going to assign the storie points of each task in the histories according with the table bellow : 

![Storie Points to days](https://github.com/arthurfreisouza/Soft_Eng/blob/main/SP_days.png)




**Arthur history : Understand genAI and document extractors, and implement the backend part of this solution.**


**Task 1 :** Make a initial research about what is genAI, and understand what is Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and how large language models can extract information from images, pdfs and some another kind of files, here the **acceptance criteria** is to create a brief summary about the technique, and group some useful links to use in the final presentation. **Storie Points => 10SP.**

**Task 2 :** Understand some simple LLM metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE, and create a brief summary to use in the final report. The **acceptance criteria** here is to have a good description about those metrics. **Storie Points => 6SP.**

**Task 3 :** Create an open-source  genAI solution that will extract information from pdfs and some simple documents and develop some tests of the response. The **acceptance criteria** here is to assert that my document extractor passes in all the tests. **Storie Points => 12SP.**

**Luis history : Understand genAI and image generators, and implement the backend part of this solution**


**Task 1 :** Make a initial research about what is genAI, and understand what is an image generator, here the **acceptance criteria** is to create a brief summary about the technique, and group some useful links to use in the final presentation. **Storie Points => 10SP.**

**Task 2 :** Understand some problems regarded to this image generator (generate harm or violent images). The **acceptance criteria** here is to have a good description about those problems. **Storie Points => 6SP.**

**Task 3 :** Create an open-source  genAI solution that will generate image from prompts and develop some tests, testing the images of the generator. The **acceptance criteria** here is to assert that my image generator passes in all the tests. **Storie Points => 20SP.**

**Pedro history : Understand genAI and image descriptors, and implement the backend part of this solution**


**Task 1 :** Make a initial research about what is genAI, and understand how an image descriptor works, and how it can describe pictures. Here the **acceptance criteria** is to create a brief summary about the technique, and group some useful links to use in the final presentation. **Storie Points => 10SP.**

**Task 2 :** Create an open-source genAI solution that will generate description from pictures or some simple documents and develop some tests of the response. The **acceptance criteria** here is to assert that my image descriptor passes in all the tests. **Storie Points => 20SP.**
